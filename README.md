# Project skeleton

This repository contains the code for our onMerrit project. The project structure used for each of the work packages is based on the [Cookiecutter Data Science project template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)

The code in this repository uses **Python 3+** (was tested with Python 3.6.4).
